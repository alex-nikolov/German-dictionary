# German-dictionary

This projects is aimed to help people keep track of words they have encountered while learning German.
The dictionary is written in Ruby as a course project at my local university.

The dictionary supports adding, editing, viewing and deleting words, as well as viewing words that share a common meaning.
Users can also engage in an interactive quiz mode where they can test their knowledge on encountered words.
High scores are kept in order to keep track of the user's progress.
